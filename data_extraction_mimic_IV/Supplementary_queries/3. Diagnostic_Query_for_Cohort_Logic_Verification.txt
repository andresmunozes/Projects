-- Query 3: Diagnostic Query for Cohort Logic Verification
-- This diagnostic query performs a case study on a single patient (subject_id = 10001884)
-- to verify the main query's cohort selection logic. It lists all of the patient's
-- historical hospital admissions and flags which of those included an ICU stay
-- with a sepsis diagnosis.
